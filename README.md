## Description

This project involves creating a command line application using Node.js that allows the user to input information for different types of employees (Manager, Engineer, and Intern), which are then used to create objects representing each employee. The application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for information and the fs package to write the employee data to an HTML file. The project demonstrates knowledge of JavaScript classes and inheritance, as well as the ability to use Node.js to create command line applications.
